The MUST Digital Notice Board System is a web-based platform that transforms university communication by replacing physical notice boards with a digital solution featuring intelligent audience targeting, real-time notifications, live chat, and engagement tracking. This innovation is significant because it solves the critical problem of students missing important announcements while being 70-90% cheaper than international alternatives, making it accessible to African universities with limited budgets. The system demonstrates that locally-developed solutions can effectively address African educational challenges while improving student success, reducing administrative costs, and promoting environmental sustainability through paperless communication. Future development plans include launching mobile applications, expanding to other Ugandan and East African universities, adding advanced features like AI-powered recommendations and event management systems, and ultimately serving hundreds of institutions across Africa to transform how millions of students access vital information and succeed in their academic journey.
