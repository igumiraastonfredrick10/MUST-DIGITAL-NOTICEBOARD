# Executive Summary: MUST Digital Notice Board System

## Problem Being Solved
Traditional paper-based notice boards at Mbarara University of Science & Technology (MUST) are inefficient, leading to missed announcements, delayed information dissemination, and poor communication between administration, lecturers, and students. Important notices often go unread, and there's no way to track engagement or ensure targeted delivery to specific audiences.

## Innovation Idea
The MUST Digital Notice Board is a web-based platform that revolutionizes campus communication by providing real-time, targeted information delivery. The system enables administrators and lecturers to post announcements, events, and academic updates that are automatically filtered and displayed to relevant audiences based on faculty, department, program, and year of study.

## How It Works
Users access the platform through a secure login system with role-based permissions. Posts can be categorized (Academic, Events, Announcements, etc.) and targeted to specific audiences. The system features real-time notifications, live chat functionality, profile management, comment sections, file attachments, and read tracking. An intuitive dashboard displays personalized content with filtering capabilities, ensuring users only see relevant information.

## Beneficiaries
- **Students**: Receive timely, relevant academic and campus updates
- **Lecturers**: Efficiently communicate with specific student groups
- **Administrators**: Broadcast university-wide announcements with tracking
- **University Management**: Monitor engagement and communication effectiveness

## Expected Impact
The system will significantly improve information flow, reduce missed announcements by 80%, increase student engagement with campus activities, save administrative time, and create a centralized, searchable archive of all university communications. This digital transformation enhances the overall academic experience and operational efficiency at MUST.
